# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the motif repository.

## Project Overview

Structural exploration of mathematics

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

Rust types (Signature, Theory, Axiom, Translation) compile to egglog DSL programs via `.to_egglog()` methods. egglog handles equality saturation.

- `crates/motif/src/signature.rs` — `Op`, `Signature` (universal algebra operations + arities)
- `crates/motif/src/theory.rs` — `Axiom`, `Theory`, `SaturationConfig` (egglog integration)
- `crates/motif/src/theories/` — Concrete theories (group, ring)
- `crates/motif/src/translate.rs` — `Translation` (s-expression symbol renaming between theories)

**egglog caveats:**
- Reserved primitive names (cannot be used as constructors): f64 `neg`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `to-f64`, `to-i64`, `to-string`; i64 `not-i64`, `log2`, `count-matches`; bool `not`, `and`, `or`, `xor`. Use `negate` for algebraic negation.
- Rewrite safety: all RHS variables must appear in LHS; bare variables on LHS cause `Ungrounded`; unbound RHS variables cause `Unbound`.
- Bidirectional rewrites only safe when both sides are constructor expressions with the same free variables. Identity laws (`f(x) = x`) and inverse laws are forward-only — reverse creates unbounded terms. Associativity is safe bidirectional.
- Seed nullary constructors: constants like `(zero)`, `(one)` must be added explicitly via `(let seed_X__ (X))` or axioms referencing them won't fire.
- Use `(ruleset name)` before any `(rule/rewrite ... :ruleset name)`; drive with `(run-schedule (repeat N (run ruleset)))`.
- iter_limit 5–10 is usually enough; 20+ with bidirectional rewrites + distributivity → blowup.

**Saturation incompleteness:** `Theory::equiv()` only proves equalities whose intermediate terms exist in the e-graph. Cross-theory comparisons must use enumeration-based checking (`discover_equiv_classes` in `explore.rs`) on both sides — `equiv()` produces false negatives (e.g. group vs abelian group). Expression count at depth 2 with 2+ vars can be 255+; prefer 1 var or depth 1.

**Discover module:** per-axiom decomposition keeps candidate products small; results joined via partial-assignment merging. Do NOT put many expressions in one e-graph with ring axioms (distributivity blows up) — use one e-graph per check (2 exprs each).

## Development

```bash
nix develop        # Enter dev shell
cargo test         # Run tests
cargo clippy       # Lint
cd docs && bun dev # Local docs
```

If a tool appears missing, you are outside `nix develop`. Do not assume the tool is unavailable to the project.

## Context Is The Only Scarce Resource

Every byte that enters the main session stays in the main session for its entire lifetime. File contents, command output, search results, page text — once read, it lingers in cache and shapes every downstream token. There is no "just looking."

**All exploration runs in subagents.** Investigations, audits, deep dives, surveys, "let me check," "let me find" — if the purpose of a tool sequence is to find out something you don't yet know, it runs in a subagent. Renaming the activity does not change what it is. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the raw output stays in the subagent.

The main session holds only the durable artifacts you are producing: the edit, the commit, the doc update.

**Subagent model tiers:**
- Opus — design, architecture, any subagent that itself spawns subagents.
- Sonnet — implementation, mechanical multi-file work, default exploration.

Use Opus for exploration only when the search requires architectural judgment, not lookup.

## Durability

Subagent reports, mid-session realizations, "I'll remember this" — none of these outlast the session. Anything worth keeping goes into CLAUDE.md, code, docs, or a commit. If it isn't written down, it is gone.

**Commit completed work immediately.** After tests pass, commit. After each phase of a multi-phase plan, commit. Uncommitted work is lost work, and accumulated uncommitted phases lose isolation as well.

**Docs change in the same commit as the code.** New pages enter the sidebar in that commit. There is no follow-up.

## Authenticity

When asked to analyze X, read X. Do not synthesize from conversation memory, prior summaries, or what the file probably says. Claims must correspond to evidence produced this session.

**Something unexpected is a signal.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, a file containing what it shouldn't — stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.

## Discipline

Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. A single correction does not warrant a CLAUDE.md edit. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly and the rule names the failure it prevents.

Do not announce actions ("I will now…"). Act.

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test -q
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**Prefer `cargo test -q`** over `cargo test` — quiet mode only prints failures, significantly reducing output noise and context usage.

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**`normalize view` is available** for structural outlines of files and directories:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`. Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
